Randomization
-------------
Groups of patients are randomized to community integrated care (intervention) or facility integrated care (control).

A patient group is represented by the ``PatientGroup`` model. A ``PatientGroup`` model instance contains patients who are represented by ``PatientLog`` model instances.

Before a group is "ready" to randomize:

* the group membership must meet the ratio of HIV, HTN, DM or multi-morbidity patients.
* the group must meet the minimum group size.
* all patients must be screened as eligible and consented

If "ready", the patient group is randomized when the ``PatientGroup`` model instance saves succcessfully
with field ``randomize_now`` set to YES.

Randomization occurs in the signal ``randomize_patient_group_on_post_save``. The signal
leaves most of the work to the class ``RandomizeGroup``. ``RandomizeGroup`` calls it's ``randomize`` method does the following:

* The group is randomized to intervention or control;
* ``PatientGroup`` model instance is allocated a ``group_identifier``;
* Each ``PatientGroup`` model instance in the group is updated with the ``group_identifier``;
* Each ``SubjectConsent`` model instance in the group is updated with the ``group_identifier`` (which triggers another signal associated with the subject consent. This signal puts the subject on schedule);
* Each ``RegisteredSubject`` model instance in the group is updated with the ``group_identifier``;
